Small app we modified along with Mateo at Globant Cordoba Hackaton.

We took a base app that was provided, which updated from twitter the tweets
with location information, and added a pin in a world map from where each tweet
came from.

Our addition was to make use of Google's translation API to detect each
message's language and translate it automatically to spanish.

The tweets were shown in a new column next to the original one.
